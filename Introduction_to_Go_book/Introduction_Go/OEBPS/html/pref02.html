<p>The first person I&#8217;d like to thank is Mark Summerfield, author of <em>Programming in Go: Creating Applications for the 21st Century.</em> If you finish this book and want to learn more, I&#8217;d recommend you pick up a copy. Mark was the person responsible for making me look at Go in the first place.</p>
<p>The next person I need to thank is Yoshiki Shibata. Yoshiki has been working on the Japanese translation of this book and, in doing so, has sent me countless emails highlighting areas that could be improved. If you enjoy reading this book then Yoshiki deserves a lot of the credit.</p>
<p>Finally, I need to thank everyone else who was involved in bringing this book from my text editor to your hands. A lot of people have earned some credit along the way. In particular, Debra Williams-Cauley, who masterminded the project, and Anne Goebel, who shepherded the book from a draft manuscript to the version you now hold.</p>
