<p>David Chisnall is a freelance writer and consultant. While studying for his PhD, he cofounded the &#201;toil&#233; project, which aims to produce an open-source desktop environment on top of GNUstep, an open-source implementation of the OpenStep and Cocoa APIs. He is an active contributor to GNUstep and is the original author and maintainer of the GNUstep Objective-C 2 runtime library and the associated compiler support in the Clang compiler. He is also a FreeBSD committer working various aspects of the toolchain, including being responsible for the new C++ stack.</p>
<p>After completing his PhD, David hid in academia for a while, studying the history of programming languages. He finally escaped when he realized that there were places off campus with an equally good view of the sea and without the requirement to complete quite so much paperwork. He occasionally returns to collaborate on projects involving modeling the semantics of dynamic languages.</p>
<p>When not writing or programming, David enjoys dancing Argentine tango and Cuban salsa, playing badminton and ultimate frisbee, and cooking.</p>
